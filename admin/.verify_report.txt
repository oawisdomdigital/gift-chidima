Notes:
- All files listed in the change log have been updated to include session start (if needed), the compiled stylesheet link, and the shared header (except redirect-only scripts like books_delete.php which only needed session start).
- The shared header still contains its own session_start() guard; this is safe and redundant but harmless.
- The pages now rely on ../frontend/dist/index.css; make sure to run the frontend build so this file exists.

Next steps:
- Run the frontend build to ensure ../frontend/dist/index.css is present on disk.
- Manually QA pages in a browser (XAMPP) with an admin session to verify layout, JS, and theme.
- Optionally remove redundant session_start() from header.php and centralize session initialization in a single include.

Scan summary (automated):
- Date: 2025-10-24 UTC
- Searched admin/ for remaining local header blocks (looking for <header> and class="header") â€” none found.
- Found header include occurrences (files already using shared header): 20 matches across admin/*.php (dashboard, gallery_form, book_form, books_list, bookme_* pages, blog_post_form, biography_form, awards_form, books_add, key_highlights_form, hero_form, final_cta_form, store_banner_form, ventures_form, testimonials_form, ads_list, ads_form).
- Found stylesheet link occurrences (../frontend/dist/index.css): 20 matches across the same set of pages.

Status: Migration for header + stylesheet link appears complete for the targeted pages listed in the change log. Remaining recommended actions: run frontend build and perform manual QA; consider centralizing session_start if you prefer a single initialization point.
